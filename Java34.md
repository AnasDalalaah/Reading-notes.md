# Monetization

To maximize your revenue, consider a flexible monetization strategy that adapts to your audiences and markets. 
Different audiences can have different preferences for paid apps, in-app purchases, subscriptions, ads, and other ecommerce.

## Sell goods or services through your app:
When you're developing a mobile application for Android and distributing it on Google Play,
there are two primary ways you can accept payments: Google Play's billing system and Google Pay.

## Sell digital goods or services with Google Play's billing system:

Use Google Play's billing system to sell digital goods or services within an app on Google Play. 
Google Play's billing system makes it easy for users to consistently, securely,
 and seamlessly purchase your goods and services for your app.
 Once users save a payment method on Google Play, they can use that same payment method for all future purchases on Google Play with just a tap.

Developers who distribute their app through Google Play are required to use Google Play's billing system to sell in-app content. 
Items that require developers to use Google Play's billing system include the following:

- Virtual game products:such as coins.
- App functionality or content: such as an ad-free version of an app.
- Subscription services: such as streaming media.
- Cloud software products: including data storage services
